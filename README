So what's this all about?

Here we have a (lib)Adwaita theme for labwc. 

Adwaita-Labwc - xbm buttons
Adwaita-Labwc-Dark - xbm buttons

Adwaita - svg buttons
Adwaita-Dark - svg buttons

The purpose of these themes is to *copy* as best we can - the goal is consistency. 

If you want out of the box consistency you will need to remove the maximise and minimise buttons in rc.xml

    <titleLayout>menu:close</titleLayout>
    
  
Issues...

-The light (normal) variant has menus that can blend into other decorations - it probably needs a border or a dropshadow.
-The padding and title bar high will probably need adjusting depending on your resolution.
