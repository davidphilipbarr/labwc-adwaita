So what's this all about?

Here we have a (lib)Adwaita theme for labwc. 

Adwaita-Labwc - xbm buttons
Adwaita-Labwc-Dark - xbm buttons

Adwaita - svg buttons
Adwaita-Dark - svg buttons

The purpose of these themes is to *copy* as best we can - the goal is consistency. 

If you want out of the box consistency you will need to remove the maximise and minimise buttons in rc.xml

    <titleLayout>menu:close</titleLayout>
  
Issues...
-The light (normal) variant has menus that can blend into other decorations - it probably needs a border or a dropshadow.

./Elements

In this directory is a rudimentary modular theme builder, spliting bits basically into light, dark and common as well as holding the image assets. 

Its very basic. At the moment is produces a theme suffixed with -gen - it's mostly to just help me maintain the light and dark themes and keep the padding consistant. 
It works but it's a bit rough.
